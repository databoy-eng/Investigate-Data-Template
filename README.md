# Introduction
In this section of the report, provide a brief introduction to the dataset you've selected for analysis. At the end of this section, describe the questions that you plan on exploring over the course of the report. Try to build your report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable and three independent variables.

If you haven't yet selected and downloaded your data, make sure you do that first before coming back here. If you're not sure what questions to ask right now, then make sure you familiarize yourself with the variables and the dataset context for ideas of what to explore.
